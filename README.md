# Integration

This repository contains Fuchsia's Global Integration manifest files.

## Making changes

All changes should be made to the internal version of this repository.
Our infrastructure automatically updates this version when the internal one
changes.

Currently all changes must be made by a Google employee. Non-Google employees
wishing to make a change can ask for assistance via the IRC channel `#fuchsia`
on Freenode.
